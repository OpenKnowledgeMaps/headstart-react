# Headstart with React and MobX Proof-of-Concept

This is the start of a new implementation of headstart using the React and MobX libraries to
to improve software sustainability, event and state management.

The project is still in a very early phase and will change quickly.

## Getting started

Since this app was bootstrappe with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
you will need to have `node` installed with a version `>=6`.
To install the necessary dependencies, issue the command `npm install` after cloning the repo.

To start a development server, just type `npm start`. A browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000`
and you can play around with the app.

You can run the test suite by running `npm test`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
